# Business_Review_Sentiment_Analysis
A NLP model that classifies business reviews, and helps simplify the process of gathering insights out of huge amounts of  business review data and provide feedback to the product of service concerned.

Businesses often times gather a humongous amount of data in form of business reviews. This is crucial for any business as it provides valuable feedback for the product or services
to improve. Therefore going through each business reveiw and understanding the feedback one by one is not plausible, therefore this model classifies every review in the corpass as either a positive review ( signifying the customers are satisfied i.e a positive feedback for the product ) and a negative reveiw ( signifying the customers not being satisfied with the product and thus implying a negative feedback for the product ).

Doing so enables the business to robustly gather insights from a review and determine the course of action rather than reading a long and emtoional review and trying to understand the type of feedback it is trying to convey.
